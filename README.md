# TurboPy app for charged particle motion

TODO: description goes here. Include equations to be solved, and info about custom turboPy modules and diagnostics.

# Installing and running this app

- Create a `turbopy` conda environment as described in the [turboPy readme](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy). 
- Clone this repo (into a directory other than the one where the turboPy core module is installed).
- Run the code:
```bash
> python ./particle_in_field.py
```
- Output is saved in `csv` format in the folder called `output`.
